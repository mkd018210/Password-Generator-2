# Password-Generator-2
I have created a password generating website. I have named it Password-Genterator-2 because the first repository I created with it was somehow linked to a repository that I didn't have access to change. I created a new repository and copied everything I had worked on before. I used some code from class as well as had help from some classmates, tutors, and ask BCS. 

The website is supposed to generate a unique password for each user. I didn't get it to work but this is what I have so far.
